## CODE:-
- This is a particular section of Github repository where we find all the internal content of the project/software. 
- Only the master of this project/software can add or remove any items from the code section.
- We are free to write code in any desired language here. For eg:- Python, Java, C++, HTML, Perl, C#, PHP, SQL, Swift, Go etc.


## ISSUES:-
- Issues are a great way to keep track of task, enhancement and bugs for our project.  
- This is a particular section of Github repository where we find all the arguments made by the users.
- Any Github user can post an argument in this section.
- Whenever any Github user posts an argument, a notification email is send to the project owner.
- We can give a tag/labels to the issues like:-"bug", "duplicate", "enhancement", "good first issue", "invalid", "help want" etc. to help organize our project.
- We get a "Text Formatting Toolbar" in the comment field of Issues.           
- As a good user its our duty to close the issue, whenever we find the find the solution of it.


## PULL REQUESTS:-
- Pullrequests let you tell others about the changes you have added to the Github-repository/project/software-tool.
- Any Github user can make a "Pull Request" to the Github repository.

## ACTIONS:-
- Github action helps to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.
- We can start a github action by creating a workflow(which contains a  '.yml' file with some codes written in it.
- You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.
- ### Steps to setup a workflow:-
  - First create a folder name `.github` in your any desired repository,then inside the ".github" create a folder name `workflows`.Finally it should look like `.github/workflows`.
  - Inside this "workflows" folder we have to create our `.ylm` files.For [example](https://github.com/Lucifer-00007/Lucifer-00007/blob/main/.github/workflows/blog-post-workflow.yml)
  - In this '.yml' file we have write our code.[Click here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) a basic overview of correct 'YAML' syntax.
  - Finally head over to the "Actions" tab in your repository and you will find the list of all workflows.
  - Select your desired workflow and click on `Run workflow`.Now if there is no error in your code, your workflow will be triggered.
  - Done!!
