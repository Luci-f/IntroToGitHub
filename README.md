# IntroToGitHub


GitHub  is  one  of  the  world's  best  platform  to share  your  coding  skills.    
It is a website where millions of developers gather every day to collaborate on open source software. 
It's also the place that hosts billions of lines of code, and also a place where users of software go to report issues they might have. 
Learn all the most important pieces of GitHub that you should know as a developer.



As  a  Developer:-


As a developer you can’t avoid using GitHub daily, either to host your code or to make use of other people’s code. 
Through my repository i will try to explains you some key concepts of GitHub, and how to use some of its features that improve your workflow, and how to integrate other applications into your process.



Why GitHub?


Now that you know what GitHub is, you might ask why you should use it.

GitHub after all is managed by a private company, which profits from hosting people’s code. So why should you use that instead of similar platforms such as BitBucket or GitLab, which are very similar?

Beside personal preferences, and technical reasons, there is one big reason: "everyone uses GitHub, so the network effect is huge".

Major codebases migrated over time to Git from other version control systems, because of its convenience, and GitHub was historically well positioned into the Open Source community.

So today any time you look up some library, you will 99% of the times find it on GitHub.

Apart from Open Source code, many developers also host private repositories on GitHub because of the convenience of a unique platform.



GitHub issues:-
It provides the owners of a repository the ability to organize, tag and assign to milestones issues.

If you open an issue on a project managed by someone else, it will stay open until either you close it (for example if you figure out the problem you had) or if the repo owner closes it.

Sometimes you’ll get a definitive answer, other times the issue will be left open and tagged with some information that categorizes it, and the developer could get back to it to fix a problem or improve the codebase with your feedback.

Most developers are not paid to support their code released on GitHub, so you can’t expect prompt replies, but other times Open Source repositories are published by companies that either provide services around that code, or have commercial offerings for versions with more features, or a plugin-based architecture, in which case they might be working on the open source software as paid developers.
