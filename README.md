# IntroToGitHub

## *GitHub  is  one  of  the  world's  best  platform  to share  your  coding  skills*.  

- It is a website where millions of developers gather every day to collaborate on open source software.

- Github  users  actually  create  "repositories"  (Which  is  nothing  but  just  like  a  folder  in  your  PC  or  Mobile)  containing  {a  "Readme.md",  Folder1(contains  codes  of  software/project),  Folder2(contains  codes  of  software/project),  Etc.}[these are all optional].  

- Therefore  in  Github  you  can  hosts  billions  of  lines  of  code,  and  also  where  other  users  can  "report issues"  that  they  might  have  related  to  a  software/project  that's  shared  by  a  developer/creator. 

- Learn  all  the  important  pieces  of  GitHub  that  you  should  know  as  a  developer.




## *As  a  Developer*:-

- As a developer you can’t avoid using GitHub daily, either to host your code or to make use of other people’s code. 

- Through my repository i will try to explains you some key concepts of GitHub, and how to use some of its features that improve your workflow, and how to integrate other applications into your process.




## *Why GitHub?    _OR_    Advantages  of  GitHub*:-
Now that you know what GitHub is, you might ask why you should use it.
 
- Beside personal preferences, and technical reasons, there is one big reason: "everyone uses GitHub, so the network effect is huge".

- Major codebases migrated over time to Git from other version control systems, because of its convenience, and GitHub was historically well positioned into the Open Source community.

- Today any time you look up some library, you will 99% of the times find it on GitHub.

- Apart from Open Source code, many developers also host private repositories on GitHub because of the convenience of a unique platform.



## *Disadvantages of GitHub*:-

- The main disadvantage with both Git and GitHub is that they both have a fairly steep learning curve.

- GitHub  is not  100%  free!!

- Being  a  version  control  the  users have to always save the progress made in Github.

- GitHub after all is managed by a private company, which profits from hosting people’s code. Thus you Can't 100% trust it. So the users should try similar platforms such as BitBucket or GitLab, which are very similar to it.
